# [![Sounds Social](docs/sound_social_logo.png)]()

**The open and social music platform.**

> Early work in progress

This platform is here to form new connections with artists, creatives and passionate listeners. No matter if it's a tiny drum loop, professional podcast or an unfinished track, Sounds Social provides a way to **share your sound** usefully.

## Are you interested?

You can play around on the [dev environment](https://sounds-social-dev.surge.sh/), have a look at the open [issues](https://github.com/matteodem/sounds-social/issues) or read through the [docs](/docs). I'm doing this in my free time and there's no monetary support as of now. 

Feel free to [let me](https://mastodon.social/@matteodem) [know](http://matteodem.ch/) if you're interested in contributing or sharing some ideas.
