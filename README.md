**The open and social music platform.**

> A work in progress

This platform is here to form new connections with artists, creatives and passionate listeners. No matter if it's a tiny drum loop, professional podcast or an unfinished track, Sounds Social provides a way to **share your sound** usefully.

As it's a WIP you can have a look at the open [issues](/issues) to get an idea or read through the [docs](/docs). [Let me](https://mastodon.social/web/getting-started) [know](http://matteodem.ch/) if you're interested in contributing.
